/* Bonfire: Where art thou
Difficulty: 1/5

Make a function that looks through a list (first argument) and returns an array of all objects that
have equivalent property values (second argument).

Remember to use RSAP if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.

Here are some helpful links:

Global Object Object.hasOwnProperty() Object.keys()

function whereAreYou(collection, source) {
  // What's in a name?
  var arr = [];
  // Only change code below this line
  
  
  // Only change code above this line
  return arr;
}

whereAreYou([{ first: "Romeo", last: "Montague" }, { first: "Mercutio", last: null }, { first: "Tybalt", last: "Capulet" }], { last: "Capulet" });
