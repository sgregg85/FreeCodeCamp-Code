/* Bonfire: Sum All Primes
DIfficulty: 2/5

Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.

A prime number is defined as having only two divisors, 1 and itself. For example, 2 is a prime
number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2. 1 isn't a prime number, because it's only divisible
by itself.

The provided number may not be a prime.

Remember to use RSAP if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.
