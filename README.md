# FreeCodeCamp-Code
My Solutions for FreeCodeCamp challeneges.

I started documenting my code on Github only while going through the 'Intermediate Algorithm Scripting'. I will add future code as I complete them and code from previous Bonfires might be added later.

I am open to any suggestions for making my code better if anyone has any suggestions
